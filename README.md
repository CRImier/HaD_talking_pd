This is example code (and packet diagram sources!) for the "Talking Low-Level PD" and "Replying Low-Level PD"
Hackaday articles by Arya Voronova (me). The code's simplified and cleaned up - for a different,
more function-wrapped (and less cleaned-up) version, see [this repo.](https://github.com/CRImier/AltmodeFriend)

I wish you luck on your PD journey, and if you're just here to take a look, I hope you like what you find!
